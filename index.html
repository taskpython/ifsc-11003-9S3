            <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                In my own words, why I think progressive enhancement is good for web development is because it helps with the user experience, making the website easily accessible to a wide variety of devices. It starts with a default website design that allows other CSS and JS files to accommodate different devices with different modularity, allowing the site to deliver core content no matter a CSS or JS failure. Its important because not all devices are made the same.

            <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
                Working on the Mars rover final project was the combination of everything we learned this semester bringing together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single course. I really liked the structure and flow of the course going from basic HTML and slowly adding in CSS and then in the end JavaScript. That way allowed me to learn 3 different languages by slowly adding up to our final project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As for my final Mars Rover Project Revision, I had some concerns about the images on the site about being too big or too small and some were not properly loaded every time, and some of them were not the correct size and were a little too big. Some of the other concerns I had was that there was the contact form either having a link or loading in. The contact page with the form I couldn't fix, but I did fix the images resizing

                HTML is an interesting language that I thought was complicated at first, but after we had the concept down, it is not that bad. I would say I struggled with CSS only because there are a lot of elements, but the way that Professor Wallace explained them and showed us the code working in action was perfect for understanding the course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I liked that HTML is the basis for any webpage that will still show information no matter if there is no CSS or JavaScript. Also, one thing that I did not know existed was GitHub code spaces and be able to have a full vs code experience in just any browser. Theres a lot to take from this course and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this course was fundamentally monumental to not only my success but also learning tools that will follow me around for the rest of my life. Thank you and Merry Chrismas!!!
