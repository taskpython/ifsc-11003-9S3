    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What were Spirit and Opportunity?</h3>
      <p>Spirit and Opportunity were twin robotic rovers sent to Mars as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. They were identical rovers designed to search for evidence of past water activity on Mars and determine whether the planet could have once supported life.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>When were the rovers launched and landed?</h3>
      <p>Spirit (MER-A) launched on June 10, 2003, and landed on Mars on January 4, 2004. Opportunity (MER-B) launched on July 7, 2003, and landed on January 25, 2004. Both rovers arrived at Mars approximately six months after their launches.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>Where did the rovers land?</h3>
      <p>Spirit landed in Gusev Crater, which scientists believed was an ancient lakebed. Opportunity landed in Meridiani Planum, inside a small crater that would later be named Eagle Crater. The two rovers landed on opposite sides of Mars.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long were the missions supposed to last?</h3>
      <p>Both rovers were designed to operate for 90 Martian days (sols), which is approximately 92 Earth days. However, both rovers far exceeded this expectation, with Spirit operating for over 6 years and Opportunity for nearly 15 years.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What were the rovers' main scientific objectives?</h3>
      <p>The primary scientific objectives were to characterize the geology and mineralogy of their landing sites, search for evidence of past water activity, and assess the potential for past or present life on Mars. Both rovers were equipped with panoramic cameras, spectrometers, rock abrasion tools, and microscopic imagers.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What did Opportunity discover about water on Mars?</h3>
      <p>Within weeks of landing, Opportunity discovered definitive evidence of ancient water on Mars by detecting hematite spheres (nicknamed "blueberries") and sulfate-rich sedimentary rocks that could only have formed in the presence of liquid water. This was one of the mission's most significant discoveries.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What happened to Spirit?</h3>
      <p>In May 2009, Spirit became stuck in soft soil at a location called "Troy." Despite extensive efforts by mission engineers, the rover could not be freed. However, Spirit continued operating as a stationary science platform until NASA lost contact in March 2010. The mission was officially declared complete in May 2011 after over 6 years of operation.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What happened to Opportunity?</h3>
      <p>In June 2018, a planet-wide dust storm engulfed Mars, blocking sunlight from reaching Opportunity's solar panels. The rover entered a low-power mode and stopped communicating with Earth. Despite attempts to reestablish contact, NASA officially declared the mission complete in February 2019 after nearly 15 years of operation.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>How far did the rovers travel?</h3>
      <p>Spirit traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) during its mission. Opportunity traveled 28.06 miles (45.16 kilometers), setting a new record for off-world distance traveled, surpassing the previous record held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 lunar rover.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What were some of Spirit's key discoveries?</h3>
      <p>Spirit discovered evidence of past hydrothermal activity and mineral deposits suggesting the presence of water in Mars' distant past. The rover climbed to the summit of Husband Hill, providing panoramic views and valuable geological data. When Spirit's wheel stopped working and it had to drag the wheel, it unexpectedly exposed bright white silica deposits, indicating past water activity.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>What were some of Opportunity's key discoveries?</h3>
      <p>Opportunity explored numerous craters including Endurance, Victoria, and Endeavour. At Endeavour Crater, the rover discovered clay minerals that formed in neutral pH water - conditions that could have supported life. The rover's longevity also allowed scientists to study seasonal changes, weather patterns, and geological processes over an extended period.</p>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>How many images did the rovers send back?</h3>
      <p>Spirit transmitted over 124,000 images during its mission. Opportunity transmitted over 217,000 images over its nearly 15-year mission.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why were these missions so successful?</h3>
      <p>The Mars Exploration Rover mission stands as one of the most successful planetary exploration missions in history. The rovers' incredible longevity, combined with their scientific instruments and strategic landing site selections, allowed them to provide compelling evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, fundamentally changing our understanding of the Red Planet's past and its potential for life.
