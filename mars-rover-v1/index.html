    <h2>Welcome to the Mars Exploration Rover Mission</h2>
    <p>In 2003, NASA launched twin robotic explorers to Mars: Spirit and Opportunity. These identical rovers were part of the Mars Exploration Rover mission, designed to search for evidence of past water activity on the Red Planet and determine whether Mars could have once supported life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit landed in Gusev Crater on January 4, 2004, while Opportunity (MER-B) touched down on the opposite side of Mars in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004. Both rovers far exceeded their planned 90-day missions, with Spirit operating for over 6 years and Opportunity for an incredible 15 years—becoming one of the most successful planetary exploration missions in history.

    </p>
    <p>

      This site explores the remarkable achievements of these twin rovers, from their groundbreaking discoveries of ancient water environments to their incredible longevity that revolutionized our understanding of Mars' past and potential for life.

        <p>Spirit landed in Gusev Crater on January 4, 2004, with a primary mission to search for evidence of past water activity on Mars. Gusev Crater was chosen as the landing site because scientists believed it was an ancient lakebed, making it an ideal location to find signs of water.</p>
        <p>During its mission, Spirit made numerous significant discoveries, including evidence of past hydrothermal activity and mineral deposits that suggested the presence of water in Mars' distant past. The rover climbed to the summit of Husband Hill, providing panoramic views of the Martian landscape and valuable geological data.</p>
        <p>In May 2009, Spirit became stuck in soft soil at a location called "Troy." Despite extensive efforts by the mission team to free the rover, it remained immobile. However, Spirit continued to operate as a stationary science platform, conducting valuable research until communication was lost in March 2010, after over 6 years of operation—far exceeding its planned 90-day mission.</p>

        <p>Opportunity landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, and immediately made a groundbreaking discovery. Within weeks of landing, the rover found definitive evidence of ancient water on Mars by detecting hematite spheres, known as "blueberries," and sulfate-rich sedimentary rocks that could only have formed in the presence of liquid water.</p>
        <p>Over its remarkable 15-year mission, Opportunity traveled over 28 miles (45 kilometers) across the Martian surface, exploring numerous craters including Endurance, Victoria, and Endeavour. The rover's longevity allowed scientists to study seasonal changes, weather patterns, and geological processes over an extended period.</p>
        <p>Opportunity's mission came to an end in June 2018 after a planet-wide dust storm blocked sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Despite attempts to reestablish contact, NASA officially declared the mission complete in February 2019. Opportunity's discoveries fundamentally changed our understanding of Mars, proving that the planet once had conditions suitable for life.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The Mars Exploration Rover mission sent twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, to Mars in 2003 as part of NASA's ongoing effort to understand the Red Planet's history and potential for life. These identical rovers were designed to operate for 90 Martian days (sols) but far exceeded expectations. Together, they revolutionized our understanding of Mars by providing compelling evidence that the planet once had liquid water on its surface, making it potentially habitable in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both rovers were equipped with a suite of scientific instruments including panoramic cameras, spectrometers, rock abrasion tools, and microscopic imagers. Their primary scientific objectives were to characterize the geology and mineralogy of their landing sites, search for evidence of past water activity, and assess the potential for past or present life on Mars.
