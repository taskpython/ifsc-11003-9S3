      <h3>Spirit (MER-A)</h3>
      <p>Spirit was the first of the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, landing in Gusev Crater to search for evidence of past water activity. Despite getting stuck in 2009, Spirit operated for over 6 years, far exceeding its planned 90-day mission and making significant geological discoveries.</p>

        <h4>2003 - Launch</h4>
        <p><strong>June 10, 2003:</strong> Spirit (MER-A) launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II rocket. The rover was encased in a protective aeroshell for its journey to Mars.</p>

        <h4>2004 - Landing and Early Operations</h4>
        <p><strong>January 4, 2004:</strong> Spirit successfully landed in Gusev Crater using an innovative airbag landing system. The rover bounced across the Martian surface before coming to rest. Initial images showed a flat, rock-strewn plain that differed from the expected lakebed terrain.</p>
        <p><strong>April 2004:</strong> Spirit began its journey toward the Columbia Hills, a range of hills that scientists hoped would reveal more about Mars' geological history.</p>

        <h4>2005 - Extended Mission Success</h4>
        <p><strong>August 2005:</strong> Spirit reached the summit of Husband Hill, providing panoramic views and confirming the rover's ability to navigate challenging terrain. The climb took over a year and provided valuable geological data.</p>

        <h4>2006-2008 - Continued Exploration</h4>
        <p><strong>2006:</strong> Spirit explored the Home Plate region, discovering evidence of past hydrothermal activity.</p>
        <p><strong>2008:</strong> Spirit's right front wheel stopped working, forcing the rover to drive backwards, dragging the wheel. This created an unexpected benefit - the dragging wheel exposed bright white silica deposits, indicating past water activity.</p>

        <h4>2009 - Final Year</h4>
        <p><strong>May 2009:</strong> Spirit became stuck in soft soil at a location called "Troy." Despite extensive efforts by mission engineers, the rover could not be freed. However, Spirit continued operating as a stationary science platform.</p>

        <h4>2010 - Mission Ends</h4>
        <p><strong>March 22, 2010:</strong> NASA lost contact with Spirit after the rover failed to respond to commands. The mission team made numerous attempts to reestablish communication, but the rover had likely entered a low-power state during the Martian winter and could not recover.</p>
        <p><strong>May 25, 2011:</strong> NASA officially declared Spirit's mission complete after over 6 years of operation. The rover had traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) and transmitted over 124,000 images.</p>

      <h3>Opportunity (MER-B)</h3>
      <p>Opportunity was the second Mars Exploration Rover, landing in Meridiani Planum and immediately discovering evidence of ancient water. Operating for nearly 15 years, Opportunity traveled over 28 miles and became one of the most successful planetary exploration missions in history.</p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <h4>2003 - Launch</h4>
        <p><strong>July 7, 2003:</strong> Opportunity (MER-B) launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Delta II rocket. The rover would arrive at Mars approximately six months later.</p>

        <h4>2004 - Landing and Early Operations</h4>
        <p><strong>January 25, 2004:</strong> Opportunity made a perfect landing in Meridiani Planum, landing inside a small crater that would later be named Eagle Crater. This fortuitous landing site immediately revealed layered bedrock that would prove crucial to the mission's scientific discoveries.</p>
        <p><strong>March 2004:</strong> Opportunity discovered "blueberries" - hematite spheres that provided definitive evidence of past water on Mars. This was one of the mission's most significant early discoveries.</p>

        <h4>2005 - Extended Mission Success</h4>
        <p><strong>September 2005:</strong> Opportunity entered Victoria Crater, one of the largest craters it would explore. The rover spent nearly two years studying the crater's exposed rock layers.</p>

        <h4>2006-2008 - Continued Exploration</h4>
        <p><strong>2007:</strong> Opportunity completed its study of Victoria Crater and began the long journey toward Endeavour Crater, located 13 miles away.</p>
        <p><strong>2009:</strong> Opportunity continued its journey toward Endeavour Crater, making stops at interesting geological features along the way.</p>

        <h4>2011-2018 - Continued Journey</h4>
        <p><strong>August 2011:</strong> Opportunity reached Endeavour Crater, a 14-mile-wide impact crater that scientists had been targeting for years. The crater's rim exposed ancient rocks from Mars' early history.</p>
        <p><strong>2012-2013:</strong> Opportunity explored the rim of Endeavour Crater, discovering clay minerals that formed in neutral pH water - conditions that could have supported life.</p>
        <p><strong>2014:</strong> Opportunity set a new record for off-world distance traveled, surpassing the previous record held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 lunar rover.</p>
        <p><strong>2015:</strong> The rover continued its exploration, studying various geological formations and providing long-term data on Martian weather and seasonal changes.</p>
        <p><strong>2016-2017:</strong> Opportunity maintained operations despite aging systems and declining solar panel efficiency. The rover explored Perseverance Valley, a channel that may have been carved by water or wind.</p>

        <h4>2018-2019 - Mission Ends</h4>
        <p><strong>June 2018:</strong> A planet-wide dust storm engulfed Mars, blocking sunlight from reaching Opportunity's solar panels. The rover entered a low-power mode and stopped communicating with Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>August 2018:</strong> As the dust storm cleared, NASA began attempts to reestablish contact with Opportunity, sending over 1,000 recovery commands.</p>
        <p><strong>February 13, 2019:</strong> After eight months of silence, NASA officially declared Opportunity's mission complete. The rover had operated for nearly 15 years, traveled 28.06 miles (45.16 kilometers), and transmitted over 217,000 images.</p>

    <h3>Mission Legacy</h3>
    <p>The Mars Exploration Rover mission stands as one of the most successful planetary exploration missions in history. Together, Spirit and Opportunity provided compelling evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, fundamentally changing our understanding of the Red Planet's past and its potential for life. The rovers' incredible longevity and scientific achievements paved the way for future missions, including the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers that continue to explore Mars today.
